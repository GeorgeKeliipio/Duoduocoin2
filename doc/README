# Setup
------
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/Duoduo (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/Duoduod (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/Duoduo (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/Duoduod (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 7890 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Duoduo works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Duoduo network.
